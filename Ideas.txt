Capstone Project Ideas


1. Animal Crossing: New Horizons animal identifier application

The app will show pictures of all the various bugs and fish from the video game Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but without names. 
The user must identity the animal by typing in its name. The app will only accept correct entries. Incorrect entries will be rejected.

2. Movie ranking application

The app will present two movies and the user can choose the "winner" or choose "neither." ("Movie A" button, "Movie B" button, "Neither" button) 
The app will then show the user the list of movies they have selected as winners.
Then, you can have the "winner" movies faceoff against one another to determine their rank in the pool of movies.

3. Upcoming concerts in your city based on list of liked artists

The app will import a list of artists from a csv or txt file, or they can be entered manually one-by-one.
It will then display a calendar showing when a liked artist is performing in their area.
